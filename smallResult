wsj870323-0097 02/23/87 frest taxes melbourne taxation is fast becoming an issue in the run-up to the australian federal election likely to take place before the end of 1987 pressure for tax reform comes from a combination of high marginal tax rates on average incomes and rapid bracket creep come july the three highest rates -- 43% 46% and 55% -- will be replaced by two rates -- 40% and 49% but most people will carry a heavier tax burden during 1987 because inflation now running at an annual rate of 12% will push them into higher brackets by the end of 1987 the proportion of income earners paying tax at a marginal rate of 40% or more will have reached almost one-half 10 years ago it was about one-fifth hardly any of the participants in the tax debate however are taking account of the positive revenue effects of lower tax rates instead it is widely assumed that income-tax cuts must be wholly financed by some combination of higher indirect taxes and cuts in public expenditure this assumption virtually destroyed prime minister bob hawke's original tax-reform policies his government held a tax summit in 1985 to secure consent for its plans for a broad-based consumption tax deemed necessary to offset large cuts in income tax the summit was a failure since it was dominated by representatives of the many interests that stood to lose in the short term from any major shift to indirect taxation collectively they vetoed the consumption tax trapped by its own analysis the government made minor cuts in income-tax rates and introduced new and unpopular taxes on fringe benefits and capital gains but having generated community interest in tax reform and having politicized so many interest groups with its summit the government finds it has created a major issue without controlling the terms of the debate recent events have served to focus the debate first the premier of the state of queensland sir joh bjelke-petersen has announced his intention to become australia's next prime minister and to implement a 25% single-rate income tax without any increases in indirect tax sir joh's ambitions have received a serious setback with the failure of his candidates to win a single seat in the march northern territory assembly election but the wave of popular support he has attracted across the nation has forced opponents to take the flat-rate-tax idea seriously second treasurer paul keating has ended speculation that the labor government was planning to repudiate the outcome of the 1985 tax summit to introduce a consumption tax and to cut income-tax rates substantially in february he announced that no major reforms were planned he emphasized the need for tax stability at a time of economic difficulty noting that a consumption tax would drive the inflation rate to disastrous levels given the government's commitment to holding expenditure at its existing level the implication was that any revenue increases would be devoted exclusively to reducing the budget deficit this is also the purpose of the expenditure-cutting financial statement the treasurer has since announced for may 14 these priorities have been endorsed by a variety of australians and organizations from former deputy secretary to the federal treasury des moore to the australian institute for public policy and the australian chamber of commerce in mandate to govern a recent study published by the latter two groups the argument was that spending cuts must come first no doubt taxes are easier to reform in times of high economic growth but then such growth will be slower to arrive without tax cuts and when it does the pressure for reform will be that much lower another voice raised was that of the centre of policy studies cops an independent policy-research institute attached to monash university melbourne in february it published tax reform -- the next steps putting forth three options all of which envisage a top marginal tax rate of 30% this tax cut would be accompanied by a range of additional fiscal measures including the removal of the existing tax-free threshold from high-income earners the three options are as follows abolishing the threshold and appropriately redesigning the social-security system using the american method of recapturing the threshold by a 5% tax surcharge over a high-income range or by a flat broad-based consumption tax of 10% at the launching of the report one of the authors noted that tax cuts should be partially self-financing through benign incentive and revenue effects but the cops strategy is based on the interlocking assumptions that tax cuts must be financed by expenditure cuts and that the voters will accept expenditure cuts only if they are compensated through tax cuts the report recommends expenditure cuts of 3.42 billion 5 billion australian for this particular purpose and a further 2.05 billion to remove the current budget deficit but however questionable the former of these assumptions may be the cops report does provide a comprehensive and much-needed set of proposals for cutting the huge outlays on health education and welfare the structure of the australian welfare state offers wide scope for such cuts although like most western welfare systems it maintains the incomes of the poorest groups it does so in a highly inefficient way the steady accumulation of spending programs especially those providing universal health and education services has resulted in much tax revenue being simply churned back into the pockets of the same taxpayers but since the middle-income groups stand to gain more in the immediate term from tax cuts than do the poor it should in principle be possible to get them off the state welfare rolls and into private provision this would enable governments to target public assistance to the needy the cops report actually proposes spending cuts in excess of 8.9 billion it finds 680 million from replacing free higher education with student fees of between 3 424 and 4 109 annually doing away with the universal medicare scheme would save 6.8 billion while preserving health-related benefits for the medically needy and the lower-income groups welfare savings of 1.37 billion could result from scrapping tax shelters for the well-off from means-testing family allowances and from reforming the unemployment-benefit scheme finally 342 million might be saved by eliminating job-creation schemes and training subsidies the next move is up to the opposition liberal-national coalition which has still not announced its tax policy it could frustrate the government's hope of fighting the election on the issue of a consumption tax by adopting one of the cops tax-cutting options that relies entirely on existing taxes in addition the coalition could advance the tax debate considerably by stressing the revenue increases that could be expected from lower tax rates in this way it could avoid having its timetable of tax reductions retarded by the inevitably slow pace of expenditure cuts --- mr james is senior lecturer in politics at la trobe university melbourne and a visiting research fellow at the centre for

wsj870323-0095 small business wedtech's fall spurs review of minority program at sba --- by steven p galante staff reporter of the wall street journal 03/23/87 wall street journal j govmt wdt bankruptcies bcy congress cng the scandal surrounding new york-based defense contractor wedtech corp has set the stage for congressional reviews of the small business administration's controversial 8 a procurement program the program which takes its name from the law that authorizes it allows minority-owned businesses to obtain federal contracts without competitive bidding the sba awarded a total of 3 billion in such contracts last year this week rep nicholas mavroules d mass who chairs a subcommittee of the house small business committee will introduce legislation to revamp the 8 a program to reduce the potential for abuse the goal is to preserve a worthwhile program while addressing some obvious problems through meaningful reform an aide to the congressman says at the same time the senate small business committee is considering holding hearings later this spring that could lead to similar legislation in that chamber the wedtech case has rekindled debate about the 8 a program which since its inception in 1968 has been plagued periodically by allegations of abuse the most recurrent problem has been the establishment of front companies ostensibly owned by minorities but in reality controlled by whites in a 1979 investigation for example the sba found that 20% of the 1 500 companies then participating in the program either weren't minority-controlled or weren't disadvantaged misuse of funds has also been a problem one company that obtained 8 a contracts later bought a racehorse that caught a cold and died though the abuses have been real they have tainted the program's reputation to a degree that many feel is unwarranted the interest in the program is usually triggered when something negative is in the air says gordon g alexander the washington d.c representative of a business group black corporate presidents of new england that's unfortunate because these businesses are putting dollars into the economy misunderstandings about the program also stem from the lack of any studies about its effectiveness in creating successful minority-owned businesses of the approximately 3 900 companies that have participated in the program 915 have graduated but it isn't known how many of those graduates survived once they were forced to bid for work the success rate should become clearer in the next month or so when the staff of the senate small business committee is expected to complete a survey of 8 a graduates a little over a year ago wedtech was considered one of the program's success stories the company had grown from a small machine shop into a major maker of pontoons engines and other equipment that provided jobs for 1 200 workers in the economically devastated south bronx over the years wedtech got 250 million of defense contracts under the 8 a program but last year state and federal prosecutors began investigating questionable company payments to politically connected law firms and consultants a special prosecutor is still investigating lobbying on wedtech's behalf by former white house aide lyn nofziger eventually wedtech officials admitted bribing government officials paying off unions forging invoices to the government and defrauding shareholders in december the company sought court protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws halted operations and dismissed its workers under new management the company has since rehired about 280 workers and resumed limited production the legislation proposed by rep mavroules is intended to eliminate the potential for many of the abuses attributed to wedtech while simultaneously strengthening sba policies aimed at ensuring that young minority companies in the program ultimately can stand on their own on the side of preventing abuses for example the bill would increase fines for individuals who set up front companies to 300 000 from 50 000 it would sharply limit the number of political appointees at the sba who make decisions about 8 a awards and it would bar sba employees from owning stock in 8 a companies on the business-development side the legislation would double the length of time a company could participate in the program to 14 years more significant it would establish a three-phase process for weaning the company from dependence on the program initial reactions to mr mavroules's bill generally have been favorable i think it would go a long way to preventing future wedtechs says mr alexander the representative of the black corporate presidents group adds ella mae horse an organizer of the national native american chamber of commerce i think it can only help the minority contractors the republican response to the mavroules bill has been more qualified massachusetts rep silvio o conte the ranking republican on the mavroules subcommittee says he supports the provisions cracking down on abuse but through an aide he expresses reservations about doubling the participation period the aide says mr conte intends to submit a bill of his own that would make significant changes in the 8 a program including eliminating the role the sba plays as a middleman between procuring agencies and contractors still mr conte says through a spokesman we think the time is right for 8 a reform we view it in one way mr mavroules views it another way we're sure we can reach a compromise

to know how congress will react it is clear that given its need to meet the gramm-rudman deficit target congress is unlikely to approve more than this year's foreign-affairs budget of 17.3 billion and may cut even deeper the current level is adequate to cover the most urgent needs but only if congress and the administration are willing to break loose from political constraints and allocate the limited funds to the most deserving programs last year congress lopped 4.2 billion off the administration's proposed foreign-affairs budget of 21.5 billion without anything very serious happening while there were some substantial reductions within the foreign-aid programs that constitute more than three-fourths of the foreign-affairs budget these cuts were more severe than necessary since neither congress nor the administration was willing to take the political heat of cutting back the 5.3 billion going to israel and egypt congress cut the largest slice -- 2.8 billion -- from security assistance this includes foreign military sales fms loans military assistance economic assistance for security-related purposes and smaller programs for foreign military training and peace-keeping operations the greater part of the 2.8 billion saving however is more illusion than reality while on the face of it congress cut fms financing 1.7 billion this reduction was taken by eliminating 1.8 billion in treasury-rate financing untouched were the 3.9 billion in concessional credits offered at subsidized rates which are usually 2.5% to 3% below the cost of money to the treasury this is a shell game at the expense of the taxpayer while the cuts look good in the short run since total outlays are reduced and the budget balance is helped over the long run deficits will be larger because of lower receipts the shift to concessional financing marks a further departure from the economic criteria that should be used to establish a country's need for military aid and the degree of concessionality it receives this year and under the proposed 1988 budget for example greece and spain countries whose economies have in the past been judged strong enough to pay the treasury rate will receive concessional loans another worrisome trend is the increasing reliance on grant military aid this is the most expensive form of military aid and was virtually eliminated during the carter administration yet last year congress approved 900 million in grant military aid the highest level since the end of the vietnam war for fiscal 1988 the administration is requesting 1.3 billion this shift toward grants and concessional loans partly reflects an effort to compensate for reduced fms financing by offering better terms the shift also aims to avoid increasing the debt burdens some countries incurred when they took on large fms loans financed by the federal financing bank at high interest rates as annual repayments on those loans become a serious burden for some countries the clamor for debt relief has increased and defaults have dissipated the guaranty reserve fund once maintained against such defaults israel has the largest fms debt burden 1.1 billion in fiscal 1988 but it is essentially relieved of repayment since it receives economic-supporting assistance in the form of cash aid that is sufficient to cover its payments moreover since payment of all of the 1.8 billion provided annually in new fms financing is forgiven -- making it in effect a grant -- israel is not building up any new fms debts egypt like israel is not required to repay its 1.3 billion in new military aid only part of its 800 million in economic-supporting assistance however is in cash this means that after meeting 500 million in payments on past military loans egypt has little u.s economic aid left to support its economic development the reagan administration has been searching for a debt-relief formula that would not trigger a general assault on the u.s treasury outright forgiveness has been rejected as too costly the administration also rejected refinancing the 18 billion in outstanding fms loans financed by the federal financing bank because of the risk that it would open the door to refinancing the rest of the bank's 150 billion in outstanding mostly domestic loans as an alternative the administration has proposed a restructuring of outstanding high-interest fms loans that would bring interest rates down to the current 7% to 8% range this proposal would bring near-term relief on interest payments but the deferred interest would be added to the principal balance and would come due at the end of the payment period in 10 to 20 years the borrowing countries would then face massive balloon payments that many might not be able to pay the administration is also offering countries that can afford to do so the option of pre-paying their high-interest fms loans this seems more likely to help the countries least needing relief such as south korea thailand greece and spain than those whose debt burdens are the most onerous the prospect that some countries will take advantage of the option to pay off their outstanding high-interest loans has near-term advantages for budget estimates the 1988 budget for example assumes that the administration will be able to manage the restructuring so that the positive effects of prepayments will override the negative effects of reduced interest payments giving a positive 26 million this is in contrast to estimated shortfalls of 770 million in 1987 and 1.7 billion in 1989 such are the government's ingenious schemes for manipulating deficit estimates of the administration's proposed 20 billion foreign-affairs budget for 1988 15 billion would go to foreign aid of that 15 billion 38% is for development aid up from the administration's request of 33% last year this is due largely to a 435 million increase for multilateral development banks bilateral development aid remains essentially unchanged at 3.3 billion while this shift in favor of development aid appears to reflect a departure from the administration's past emphasis on security-related aid it is probably more a response to congress's tendency to cut security assistance more severely moreover while the administration is requesting 1.4 billion less in security aid than last year the saving is offset by greater concessionality outright grants increase from 75% to 85% and all fms financing is at concessional interest rates under democratic leadership congress is not likely to favor an increase in security aid at the expense of bilateral development aid the greatest cuts are likely to be made in security assistance and a proposed substantial increase for multilateral development banks -- a proposal that rep david obey d wis chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee of the house appropriations committee said earlier this month doesn't stand a chance of a snowball in hell although it is unlikely to increase military grants by nearly 50% as proposed by the administration congress might be tempted to go along with some increase in grants as well as greater concessionality in fms loans especially if the outlay effects can be masked by prepayments of past fms loans but greater concessionality is a move in the direction of higher costs and prolonged dependency -- exactly the wrong direction for our security-assistance program instead congress should hold the line by rejecting any increase in security assistance especially in grants and by requiring that concessional fms financing be offered only where economic criteria justify it lacking any broad consensus on the purposes of foreign aid and unwilling to take on domestic supporters of key recipients such as israel egypt and greece congress is unlikely to give the administration much leeway in allocating the available funds if as seems all too likely congress cuts foreign aid again while maintaining current earmarks it will further distort a program in which aid to israel and egypt equals u.s bilateral and multilateral aid to the rest of the world but this is to be expected of a foreign-aid program that lacks a coherent rationale and is largely devoted to satisfying the efforts of special interests to protect the aid levels of a few favored countries while congressional pressures on overall aid levels coming largely from the budget and appropriations committees have forced some overdue cuts few knowledgeable persons in either the administration or congress would argue that the resulting program represents a sound allocation of the limited resources available little is likely to be done about this in the dying years of the reagan administration but it is not too soon for congress to initiate a comprehensive critical reappraisal of foreign aid --- mr shaw who teaches international law at george washington university was chief of the military-assistance branch of the office of management and budget from 1967 to 1980 
wsj870323-0088 bourse report hong kong stocks are volatile of late but boost from local economy is seen --- by marcus w brauchli special to the wall street journal 03/23/87 wall street journal j frest japan canda europ stock market offerings stk precious metals stones gold silver pcs commodity news farm products cmd hong kong the british colony's stock market has displayed sharp volatility recently after an easy climb to new heights earlier in the year in the first half of march the hang seng index which tracks 33 major stocks plummeted more than 11% from the record 2939.05 registered march 3 the string of losses ended abruptly wednesday though when the indicator rebounded nearly 95 points or about 3.5% in a single session the index edged lower again thursday but surged 59.27 points friday to close the week at 2780.55 although earnings-related trading and overseas investors alike have played a role in the recent turbulence essentially it is a transient technical reaction to a february rally that saw the hang seng index climb nearly 15% hong kong securities analysts say brokers as well as analysts expect stocks to settle into a steady upward trend again soon backed by strong economic and financial fundamentals when the dust finally settles we expect this market to pick up considerably says david harman an equities manager at berisford cresvale far east ltd a british securities firm following february's solid performance mr harman says a normal correction of some size could have been expected and in fact was overdue the correction was exacerbated by its timing coming just as major companies were reporting last year's results people usually sell into results in hong kong mr harman says earnings for major companies listed on the colony's stock exchange so far are up at least 30% on average in line with local expectations but news that several big groups were planning reorganizations and rights issues spurred profit-taking among the companies seeking to raise money through such issues are hongkong amp shanghai banking corp jardine matheson strategic holdings ltd hongkong land co and new world hotels ltd the total cost of those proposed issues to shareholders will be about the equivalent of 897.3 million rights issues contributed to the market's recent slump by forcing local investors to skim profits from their portfolios to finance their portions of the issues says stuart cook a director of research at the hong kong office of james capel amp co a british securities firm owned by hongkong bank very soon now the issues should be well and truly discounted in the market mr cook says local investors who have been pushing the market lower often are quicker to adjust their positions than foreign investors he says many of market's foreign participants started investing only in the past several years -- and since august in particular when tokyo's stock market faltered so they aren't accustomed to the rapid pace of share turnover practiced by many local institutions this is one of the world's busiest markets a broker says noting that the average daily turnover has increased about sevenfold from a year ago if hong kong's average daily turnover of 182 million persists in a year the equivalent of nearly three-quarters of the exchange's total capitalization of around 60.24 billion will change hands still even though locals generally trade their portfolios more frequently much of that liquidity derives from the recent foreign investment and because foreign institutions have been buying heavily most were unwilling to take on additional shares to prop up the market when local selling knocked it lower this month nor would the foreign houses sell -- and take losses -- at the market's lower levels so volume has declined even as the market's volatility has increased the market should emerge from its current volatility soon and head higher analysts say noting that the economic fundamentals backing the market are among the strongest in asia hong kong is the only market in asia with rapidly improving fundamentals says john c quinn a director of chase manhattan trust co.'s hong kong office we don't see any big downside risk here a chief factor supporting the market is hong kong's strong export-driven economy which should grow at least 6% this year after swelling around 9% last year the colony's government says the stability of the local currency which is officially linked to the u.s dollar at a rate of 7.8 hong kong dollars to one and relatively low interest rates which have bolstered local property prices considerably in the past year are chief factors as well fundamentally hong kong is one of the strongest markets in the world says caspar li an assistant director of research at vickers da costa amp co a brokerage owned by citicorp mr li though cautions that unexpected political news always poses a threat to the stock market in the british territory which will revert to chinese sovereignty in 1997 when chinese communist party leader hu yaobang was removed abruptly from his post in january amid student demonstrations in china hong kong's stock market shuddered noticeably

wsj870323-0087 who's news visa's outspoken president leads charge against american express --- by richard b schmitt staff reporter of the wall street journal 03/23/87 wall street journal j axp financial insurance mutual funds accounting leasing fin banks thrift institutions bnk san mateo calif charles t russell used to play trombone in pittsburgh burlesque houses and with big bands in the southeast he gave it up for banking but he still knows how to attract a crowd mr russell the president of visa international a bank-owned credit-card association recently urged members to consider halting sales of american express co services in retaliation for the financial-service giant's recent decision to begin offering a new cut-rate credit card consumer groups denounced the plea as an illegal restraint of trade and congress is considering an inquiry but mr russell is resolute banks need to realize that there is a fox in the henhouse he declares visa and the 56-year-old mr russell who enjoys riding a harley-davidson motorcycle have collided with consumers and congress before critics have long alleged that visa member banks and other card issuers inflate interest rates as in past years congress is currently considering imposing rate ceilings and some consumer groups think such a law would be an appropriate response to mr russell's recent harangue but the push in congress has fallen short in the past with mr russell's plain talk helping to lead the opposition he is more vociferous but his statements probably reflect the general thought of the leading card issuers says pete hart a first interstate bancorp executive vice president forewarned first interstate which offers american express gold cards and travelers checks is reevaluating our relationship with american express according to mr hart nothing rash is planned he says but the new card -- optima -- is without question an intrusion into our business american express and the banks are used to being allies rather than adversaries american express cards generally don't offer revolving credit and banks have marketed them alongside their visa and mastercard cards which do but optima will compete head-on the card will cost 15 a year in addition to the 45 that american express charges for its regular card but it will extend 13.5% credit the average visa card also carries a 15 annual fee but it has a stiffer 17.5% rate and several big banks charge even more american express says only a limited number of existing customers will be offered the new card it doesn't expect to issue many more than two million of them by 1990 compared with about 100 million current visa card holders it doesn't know what the fuss is all about we are not basically in the credit business says an american express spokesman we're going after a select market but the elite group that american express is targeting has been a major source of bank credit card earnings banks also believe that the american express estimates are too modest and some fear a plastic rate war they aren't going to fail says mr russell i don't admire their ethics but i certainly respect their knowledge he thinks american express is misleading consumers arguing that the optima rate is closer to 18% when the tie-in with the regular card is considered the flap comes at a time when visa and its members have few other reasons to complain there are 22% more visa card holders world-wide than there were two years ago the group which furnishes members with new products system support and other services is developing computerized cards and new links with automated teller machines for the banks credit cards have been a growing source of profits although tax changes and a growing consumer debt load portend possibly slower future growth in orchestrating visa's expansion mr russell has hit a few wrong notes with bankers and competitors two years ago he led the opposition against a merger proposal from rival mastercard an idea that some bank issuers of both cards thought would cut costs for them and consumers mr russell says that the benefits were overrated and that a merger raises possible antitrust problems instead he has backed joint efforts but some question his interest in cooperating visa and mastercard have been studying a national network to process retail store debit card transactions last fall however visa agreed to manage a large similar operation in california and some mastercard officials worried that the joint venture had been doomed mr russell denies this his comments about american express also have some precedent last summer as part of a campaign to blunt another budding competitor visa encouraged members to refuse to honor sears roebuck amp co.'s discover card in their automated teller machines along the way critics believe consumers have been cheated card rates haven't fallen nearly as sharply as other interest rates since 1980 current rates also reflect a jump in write-offs of bad credit card loans which some banks have brought upon themselves through aggressive marketing mr russell argues that usury laws depressed rates below market levels years ago making current rates seem high he also says critics ignore administrative costs in their rate attacks the steeper write-offs he contends stem more from lax bankruptcy laws and heavy unemployment in the major oil-producing states than indiscriminate card marketing while mr russell faces possible congressional and justice department investigations into his american express comments he says visa welcomes the attention we've nothing to hide never had adds the executive who joined visa in 1971 like scores of musicians he put down his horn when television arrived in the 1950s while hunting for a music-store job one day in 1953 a rainstorm forced him to take cover at a branch of what is now pnc financial corp the bank hired him as a collector in its installment loan department he married a former pittsburgh radio singer who he used to back up in the band weather permitting mr russell commutes every day from his novato calif home in his single-engine airplane the 20-minute flight helps him forget his troubles you can't think about anything else when you're flying he says when i fly home i don't have a problem anymore

wsj870323-0083 manager's journal a private concern still needs a public profile --- by henry o timnick 03/23/87 wall street journal j tender offers mergers acquisitions tnm huge billion-dollar leveraged buyouts lbos were a major feature on the 1986 financial landscape this year names like viacom international inc and owens-illinois inc continue to steal headlines as tax-reform and takeover fears fuel lbo announcements and speculations yet behind the headlines is the fact that well over 200 of the approximately 315 lbos announced in 1986 were divestiture lbos in which overgrown conglomerates sold parts of their empires to division managers where managers are resourceful and energetic and believe in their capabilities as directors and owners -- rather than as employees -- lbos have worked well after the glow of pride fades from lining up the numbers and putting the deals together what can corporate managers expect to find as the new owners of their former company stores one serious threat to success is the inability of some managers to make the transition from company men to entrepreneurs others become so absorbed with cost cutting and debt reduction that they forget to reinvest in the underlying business many managers also miss the abundant opportunities for reducing operating costs in areas where they have no technical competence such as pensions medical programs and insurance substantial savings can be realized in each of these areas without reducing benefits or coverage but the biggest danger in going private lies in management becoming close-mouthed many buyout groups react to freedom from quarterly earnings statements and shareholders by constructing moats around their companies building real value whether a firm is public or private means not only communicating company strategy to employees but talking with outsiders as well in 1979 i was a group president of mead corp in charge of virginia-based stanley furniture co stanley was healthy but had not achieved its full potential as part of a big paper company when i studied the situation i quickly realized that mead would be better off without the 120 million contributed by furniture and fabric sales and that stanley would be better off without mead's corporate structure stanley no longer fit mead's strategy it was also clear to me that furniture divisions of large corporate entities usually did not perform well therefore stanley's managers opted for a leveraged buyout the risks our buyout group faced seven years ago were enormous -- personally and professionally none of us was wealthy we all had to take out second mortgages to help finance our investments in stanley interest rates had surged beyond 20% and business was in its worst slump since world war ii gone were the security perks and resources of the parent company if the venture failed the 2 000 jobs that supported the economy of stanleytown va would disappear along with our investment but i was confident that a revitalized stanley even as a highly leveraged enterprise could prosper as an owner i learned that we needed to do more than agree on management objectives -- we had to communicate our resolve to everyone working at stanley this came to a head during an early planning session when a production manager asked what company policy was on a particular matter i don't know i said it's our company now we have to create the policy from that point on we set in motion an open-door communications program to get both our managers and employees thinking like spirited owners this type of aggressive dialogue wasn't necessary under corporate rules where everyone knew his place but it was an essential ingredient in our new company i made a special effort to keep our banks informed of our progress much the way the chief executive officer of a public company gives updates to securities analysts we discussed the results of marketing plans and new products with the banks and improved their feelings of confidence toward us at critical stages of our development similarly we kept the press customers and local officials informed of company developments when i had been a division president i rarely had time to spend with retailers but as a manager-owner it was important for me to keep customers informed of our long-range plans we also didn't forget stanleytown civic programs such as scholarships and recreational facilities were maintained and in many cases enhanced in essence stanley was a private company with a public profile our dialogue with employees extended to company finances as well we opened the books to all managers and they in turn began to appreciate what cash flow was all about soon they were no longer talking about what they had to have but about what they no longer needed we also set up performance incentives that reached well down the chain of command -- incentives based on long-term profitability not just revenue growth companies that undergo leveraged buyouts must learn quickly to cope with their problems in order to maximize cash flow and pay off debts without compromising growth many of the executives in these newly created private companies will protest that they don't have the time or resources to waste on communicating their goals but it is the obligation of management groups to talk candidly to employees and the outside world especially during the early stages following a buyout that's when the greatest opportunity exists to shape an lbo company into an entrepreneurial enterprise --- mr
